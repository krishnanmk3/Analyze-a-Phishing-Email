By observing  above mail i was identified  Phishing email




 Red Flags in the Email
1. Suspicious Sender Address
   * From: jekasot515@percyfx.com
      * Microsoft would never use a random domain like percyfx.com for billing.
      * Legitimate Microsoft emails come from @microsoft.com, @account.microsoft.com, or @email.microsoft.com.
2. Fake Payment Link
   * URL: https://paypal.secure-login.net
      * This is not a Microsoft or PayPal domain.
      * A real Microsoft invoice link would go to https://account.microsoft.com/billing.
3. Urgent Payment Threat
   * "Payment is due by August 10, 2025 to avoid service interruption."
      * Phishing emails often create fake urgency to pressure victims.
4. Generic Greeting
   * "Dear Accounts Payable Team" instead of your name.
      * Microsoft usually personalizes emails with your account name.
5. Fake Contact Info
   * The phone number +1 (855) 246-7890 is not an official Microsoft support line.
   * Real Microsoft billing support: 1-800-642-7676 (US).
